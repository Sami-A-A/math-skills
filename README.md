## About this Project

This project was developed for educational purposes under the [Reboot 01 curriculum](https://reboot01.com/curriculum/). 

Math Skills is a program that takes a statistical population and finds its average, median, variance and standard deviation then prints the rounded values onto the console. It's not that deep I know but it was a fun project to work on regardless and was good practice for writing in my language of choice in Golang. 

Have fun!

## Objective

The objective of this program is to calculate the following and print the results as rounded integers:
* <u>Average</u> of the given set
* <u>Median</u> of the given set
* <u>Variance</u> of the given set
* <u>Standard Deviation</u> of the given set

## Usage

1. Navigate to ```cmd/``` on the terminal 
2. In the ```data.txt``` file enter a range of numbers
    - Every entry must be followed by a new line
    - Every number must be an integer
3. From the terminal run the following command:

    - ```go run math-skills.go data.txt```


## Technologies
